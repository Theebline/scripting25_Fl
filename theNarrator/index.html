        <p>The Narrator is a middle-classed, middle aged man who works as a insurance company as a recall coordinator.
            He inspects car accidents to determine if an automobile should be recalled. He feels as if he's a copy of a
            copy. He suffers from chronic insomnia, which causes him to slog through life in a half-asleep depression.
            He embodies the archetype of the average businessman. He lacks any sort of fashion sense. After seeing a
            doctor about his insomnia, his doctor recommended him to attend some support groups to see what real pain
            looks like. For the first time he feels relief, he cries, he consoles the others in the group. He finally
            finds sleep. The narrator fills his life with materail posessions, finding himself always looking for the
            next piece of <i>IKEA</i> funiture. Trying to define himeself through the posessions he surrounds himself
            with.</p>

        <p>The Narrator meets Tyler on one of his many flights. Tyler embodies everything the narrator could only hope
            to be. He has a sense of style, a sense of fashion. He doesn't put up with any shit. He's carismatic, and he
            exudes confidence. After their chance meeting on the flight, and after the Narrator discovers his appartment
            has blown up with all of his precious possessions. <br> They grab a beer at a pub, and this is where the
            Narrator and Tyler really develop a partnership. After chatting over some beers, they go outside, and Tyler
            asks the Narrator to punch him. This punch, starts the beginning of Fight Club. After having a few fights
            themselves, others started asking to join. Building Fight club into quite the little organization. During
            the day they would be their usual unsuspecting selves, working at their jobs. The Narrator at his job as a
            recall coordinator, and Tyler at various jobs such as a projectionist, or working at a hotel in the food
            service industry. The club is home to eight rules:
        <ol>
            <li> You don't talk about Fight Club</li>
            <li> You <b>DO NOT TALK</b> about Fight Club</li>
            <li> When someone says stop, or taps out, or goes limp, the fight is over</li>
            <li> Only two guys to a fight</li>
            <li> One fight at a time </li>
            <li> No shoes, no shirts </li>
            <li> Fights will go on as long as they have to</li>
            <li> If its your first night at Fight Club, you have to fight</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        These rules are followed to a tee. As the club builds larger, this pushes Tyler to expand the club. Creating
        Project Mayhem, and thus, creating the Space Monkeys.

            alt="Project Mayhem">
        <p>Project Mayhem was born our of Fight Club. After Tyler discovered that the first two rules have been getting
            broken, he assigns "homework assignments" for all the members to get in a fight with a stranger. Eventually
            the homework assignments grow more dangerous. Blowing up TV's, destroying cars. Eventually Fight Club gets
            renamed to Project Mayhem, becoming a anti-society oganization. The new recruits must wait outside their
            house on Paper St. for three days. They must wait as The Narrator or Tyler come out every day and berate
            them. If they can stick it out, their heads get shaved, and they become "Space Monkeys". The Narrator
            evemtually fights himself in his boss's office, making it seem as if his boss had done the deed. The
            Narrator demanding a very large pay increase, along with no longer needing to come into the office. This
            allowed the Narrator to put more funds into Project Mayhem alongside Tyler. The Narrator eventually starts
            to resent Tyler as he continues to take credit for the things Project Mayhem is doing. </p>

        <p>The Narrator lashes out at Tyler, causing Tyler to reveal that he was the one who blew up his appartment. The
            early hints that something isnt right starts with Marla Singer, from Marla's point of view, they have very
            contradictory interactions, confused phone calls. Things truly take a turn when The Narrator tries to stop
            Tyler. Tracking him across the country is whem things start to come undone. Every city the Narrator goes,
            Project Mayhem members refer to him as Tyler. As the Narrator continues to discover that Tyler has been
            using the Narrator's body. As Jack (The Narrator) starts to realize that he himself is actually Tyler, he
            decides to try and take things into his own hands. The Narrator tries to stop Tyler from destroying the
            major credit card companies, esentially reseting everyone to zero. Tyler takes matters into his own hands,
            with the Narrator waking up in a chair, atop a skyscraper, with Tyler holding a gun in his mouth. In
            reality, the Narrator is holding a gun in his own mouth. After shooting himself, effectivly killing Tyler
            Durden. </p>
